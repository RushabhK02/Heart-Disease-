Random Forest Classifier for Heart Disease prediction

Hi, I have tried to implement the Random Forest Classifier for the Heart Disease classification problem. 
The dataset has been taken from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/kralmachine/analyzing-the-heart-disease/data
Since I have recently started implementing Machine learning for practical problems, I have tried to analyze the data distribution for each feature and tried to make a random forest classifier.
